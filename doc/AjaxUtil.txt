The following documents several design desition about the AjaxUtil/JsonUtil Object.

ajaxWrapper: The ajaxWrapper Object is an enhanced version of the object used by jQuery.ajax.
its purpose is to add functionality for the AjaxUtil object be able to function. The baseline is that the 
ajaxWrapper must have at least the same properties expected by jQuery.ajax. That includes:
	- url: for more info see jQuery doc
	- success: for more info see jQuery doc
	- error: for more info see jQuery doc
	- complete: for more info see jQuery doc
	- beforeSend: for more info see jQuery doc
	

The ajaxWrapper adds support for the following properties:

	- doRetry: specifies if the request should be queue (true) for retry upon failure or not
	- retry: counter with a count of how many times the request has been retried. Only used if doRetry=true
	- data: Contains the JSON Object return in the XHR response (xhr.responseText)
	- status: The HTTP code in the response (200/Success)
